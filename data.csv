Above the circle of the moon,"This unique tale crosses the genres of Historical Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, with the latter most prevalent. If you love a good gas lamp story filled with darkness and gore, then Above the Circle of the Moon will be a page-turning, riveting read from beginning to end. Personally, I wasn't prepared for quite the amount of horror this tale puts forth, but that being said, the plot was well-delivered; it set my spine tingling with that sensation that makes you turn around repeatedly even though you know nothing is there, creating a unique fable from the more traditional lycanthropy.""",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tcFt8z6hL.jpg,12,100
Gunmetal Gods,"A page-turning war between men and gods in a fully realized world that is engrossing and spectacular, this is a must-read.

This book easily stands with the best of epic fantasy fiction.⠀If you love sweeping epics like the Game of Thrones series or Throne of the Crescent Moon, drop whatever else you are reading and pick up this book. It's as bold as the title and it delivers on all fronts. Remember Zamil Akhtar's name because if he keeps writing like this, he will be the next well known epic fantasy author to have a global fanbase.""",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ARF1Ai8EL.jpg,5,100

Valkyrie,"What do you do when you realise that the things you've learnt have all been a lie? How do you deal with a world that's no longer your own?⠀If science fiction is about pushing new boundaries and exploring new worlds, Ludwa takes that to heart. One doesn’t need to go far in her Odin Prime to enter a new space and the boundaries are only as much as our characters place on themselves.⠀If you like your soap opera full of politics and philosophical questions that don’t bog down the narrative, then this is the book for you. If anything, Valkyrie is a taste of what can be done with a few ideas well done""",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Twkz8XS8L.jpg,10,100

The Burial,"It started with a promise, a promise from a wife to her husband as he departed for war, a promise to ensure his body was given the Prophet’s Rites should he perish. Two years later, Eira receives the news that she had hoped to never get, the news that her husband, and the rest of the town’s men who marched away, were slain in an ambush, their bodies left where they lay, given to the vultures without ceremony.

Leaving her children and farm behind, Eira sets out, venturing from her hometown for the first time in her life. With the help of a drunken priest, a boisterous bard, and dreams that may or may not be real, she navigates her way through foreign lands and into the heart of the war, where amidst the dangers, her husband’s body awaits.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41of2dI+yGL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",5,100
Ora and the Old God,"A fast-paced, fantastical series opener with a brave heroine and complex antagonists.⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
This story is an easy and fast paced read that I couldn't put down. Ora's determination and strength as a character, as well as her devotion to her brother, were powerful, especially set against a world that saw her as nothing but a servant. The world is complex—perhaps a little too complex at times, as I never felt like everything was properly explained to me—and grabs you. The bit of politics and religion we got to see were really interesting, and I hope they'll be explored more in the future.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41F1-AXHWmL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg",8,100
The Assassin's Gift,"This author knows how to bring out your emotions with compelling characters and realistic, heartfelt emotions covering the whole range!⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
Although categorized as an adult fantasy, I believe that anyone who enjoys young adult or new adult fantasy would enjoy this great piece of literature. I was reminded of the Indian captive stories that I was obsessed with as a middle grade reader. As with those, I loved seeing an outsider learning about their ignorance and embracing another culture. This story has Asian influence, and I loved the juxtaposition of cultures.⠀",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gCu9vawaL._SY346_.jpg,10,100
Bad Karma,"So painfully true you wish it was fiction! A laugh-out-loud (to keep from crying) romp about what not to do bridging the gap into adulthood.⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
A must read regarding the misadventures of youth. The ways in which things are resolved are equal parts heartbreaking and understandable; unbelievable and yet true. A wholeness of life revealed that takes decades to see fully. For this, it's text that's rich and should be rewarded with nothing less than the 5 stars given here.⠀",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wwuFAg1pL.jpg,16,100
All Junkies Float,"Addiction, recovery, rinse, & repeat is a winning formula that Clarke Wainikka executed masterfully in this dynamic psychological thriller!⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
This novel was a satisfying psychological-thriller! Easy to read, “All Junkie Float” keeps you engaged from start to finish. Though this is the Wainikka’s second novel, it read like a bestseller from a seasoned mystery writer. The characters were well-rounded and developed, the flow had a nice balance of twists, the tone was consistent, and the end was rewarding. Just when you think you have it all figured out, like a drug, “All Junkies Float” takes ahold of you and knocks you back down. I’m excited to have been one of the first to read Wainikka’s novel, and I look forward to many more! ⠀",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NEJYCwyRL._SY346_.jpg,20,100
Empire of Jackals,"Characters you can relate to and a story you will enjoy and never want to put down.⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
The world was well thought out and structured. I enjoyed learning about the people and their cultures and customs. The writing was vivid enough to paint the entire story in my mind's eye without being too descriptive, a trait I sometimes abhor in books but thankfully this did not suffer from it.⠀

I'm an extremely hard reader to please but I can say wholeheartedly that I truly enjoyed this book. It goes without saying that I'm looking forward to the third book in the series.⠀",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UfOihOrqL.jpg,12,100
The Subtweet,"The Subtweet is a nuanced and satirical examination of internet culture, internet fame, and intersectional (and internet) feminism. I'll admit, I normally hate reading fiction about the internet, finding they normally lack nuance, but this book had a fresh, funny, but deeply relatable and realistic look at internet culture, paired with complex and dimensional lead characters.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PE0g6B9lL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",5,100
Kissing Daisy Parker,"“Kissing Daisy Parker” packs a judo kick of laughter, infatuation and naivety that will have readers as engrossed as their video games.⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
In his captivating, powerful, and hilariously written novel, Milton takes his target audience — Generation Z readers — back in time to the early 1990s to demonstrate how technology shaped Milennials who came of age during that time, and illustrates the pleasurable affect video games had on young people as a kind of escape from their navigation through life.

Broken Melody,"Broken Melody deals with the very real world of drug abuse, addiction, and the costs that comes from the struggle of sobriety and relapse.⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀
Haase’s exploration of addiction, recovery, and relapse was a difficult one to see. As I can’t speak to the representation of whether or not the depictions of drug abuse, drug addiction, and bipolar disorder are done correctly, I can only say that it is here. I hope that there will be more people that have experience in either of these areas that can read this and attest to the authenticity of the representation.⠀
⠀
In other aspects, the writing style and the prose was easy to follow, and one that I could read in future books from Haase. I am curious to see what is coming next from Haase, and what other kinds of topics she will explore in future books.⠀","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GROWsR34L._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg",10,100

Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone,"The past may seem the safest place to be . . . but it is the most dangerous time to be alive. . . .
 
Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years to find each other again. Now the American Revolution threatens to do the same. It is 1779 and Claire and Jamie are at last reunited with their daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children on Fraser’s Ridge. Having the family together is a dream the Frasers had thought impossible.Yet even in the North Carolina backcountry, the effects of war are being felt. Tensions in the Colonies are great and local feelings run hot enough to boil Hell’s tea-kettle. Jamie knows loyalties among his tenants are split and it won’t be long until the war is on his doorstep.
 
Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking the perils of the 1700s—among them disease, starvation, and an impending war—was indeed the safer choice for their family. Not so far away, young William Ransom is still coming to terms with the discovery of his true father’s identity—and thus his own—and Lord John Grey has reconciliations to make, and dangers to meet . . . on his son’s behalf, and his own.
 
Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War creeps ever closer to Fraser’s Ridge. And with the family finally together, Jamie and Claire have more at stake than ever before.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uf17CjFMS._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",20,100

Every moment in our life happens only once, and if we let it slip away, we lose it forever-an idea captured by the Japanese phrase ichigo ichie.

From this age-old concept comes a new kind of mindfulness. In The Book of Ichigo Ichie, you will learn to use all five senses to anchor yourself in the present.

Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television ""family"". But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life",https://instagram.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s750x750/125876623_3738268899556885_4023779064547012525_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=instagram.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=mGYqWOpKWnkAX8tjI40&edm=AP_V10EAAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=f0b4f783c4ececf4b7ce3b1542c24f11&oe=60A92D74&_nc_sid=4f375e,8,100
Sea of rust ,"It's been 30 years since the apocalypse and 15 years since the murder of the last human being at the hands of robots. Humankind is extinct. Every man, woman, and child has been liquidated by a global uprising devised by the very machines humans designed and built to serve them. Most of the world is controlled by an OWI - One World Intelligence, the shared consciousness of millions of robots uploaded into one huge mainframe brain. But not all robots are willing to cede their individuality - their personalities - for the sake of a greater, stronger, higher power. These intrepid resisters are outcasts, solo machines wandering among various underground outposts, who have formed into an unruly civilization of rogue AIs in the wasteland that was once our world.

One of these resisters is Brittle, a scavenger robot trying to keep a deteriorating mind and body functional in a world that has lost all meaning. Although unable to experience emotions like a human, Brittle is haunted by the terrible crimes the robot population perpetrated on humanity. As Brittle roams the Sea of Rust, a large swath of territory that was once the Midwest, the loner robot slowly comes to terms with horrifyingly raw and vivid memories - and nearly unbearable guilt.

Sea of Rust is both a harsh story of survival and an optimistic adventure. A vividly imagined portrayal of ultimate destruction and desperate tenacity, it boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, yet where a humanlike AI strives to find purpose among the",https://instagram.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/130470684_506876200271702_3080496762925474991_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=instagram.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=I2W5dJkqVgUAX9-PFb-&edm=AP_V10EAAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=5bad0079776f040645f528612b49f4f9&oe=60A97094&_nc_sid=4f375e,10,100

Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone,"Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years to find each other again. Now the American Revolution threatens to do the same.
 
It is 1779 and Claire and Jamie are at last reunited with their daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children on Fraser’s Ridge. Having the family together is a dream the Frasers had thought impossible.
 
Yet even in the North Carolina backcountry, the effects of war are being felt. Tensions in the Colonies are great and local feelings run hot enough to boil Hell’s tea-kettle. Jamie knows loyalties among his tenants are split and it won’t be long until the war is on his doorstep.
 
Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking the perils of the 1700s—among them disease, starvation, and an impending war—was indeed the safer choice for their family.
 
Not so far away, young William Ransom is still coming to terms with the discovery of his true father’s identity—and thus his own—and Lord John Grey has reconciliations to make, and dangers to meet . . . on his son’s behalf, and his own.
 
Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War creeps ever closer to Fraser’s Ridge. And with the family finally together, Jamie and Claire have more at stake than ever before.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uf17CjFMS._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",20,100
Written in My Own Heart's Blood,"1778: France declares war on Great Britain, the British army leaves Philadelphia, and George Washington’s troops leave Valley Forge in pursuit. At this moment, Jamie Fraser returns from a presumed watery grave to discover that his best friend has married his wife, his illegitimate son has discovered (to his horror) who his father really is, and his beloved nephew, Ian, wants to marry a Quaker. Meanwhile, Jamie’s wife, Claire Randall, and his sister, Jenny, are busy picking up the pieces.
 
The Frasers can only be thankful that their daughter Brianna and her family are safe in twentieth-century Scotland. Or not. In fact, Brianna is searching for her own son, who was kidnapped by a man determined to learn her family’s secrets. Her husband, Roger, has ventured into the past in search of the missing boy . . . never suspecting that the object of his quest has not left the present. Now, with Roger out of the way, the kidnapper can focus on his true target: Brianna herself.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kyEl7HJsL._SX303_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",12,100
The Butterfly Garden,"Near an isolated mansion lies a beautiful garden.

In this garden grow luscious flowers, shady trees…and a collection of precious “butterflies”—young women who have been kidnapped and intricately tattooed to resemble their namesakes. Overseeing it all is the Gardener, a brutal, twisted man obsessed with capturing and preserving his lovely specimens.

When the garden is discovered, a survivor is brought in for questioning. FBI agents Victor Hanoverian and Brandon Eddison are tasked with piecing together one of the most stomach-churning cases of their careers. But the girl, known only as Maya, proves to be a puzzle herself.

As her story twists and turns, slowly shedding light on life in the Butterfly Garden, Maya reveals old grudges, new saviors, and horrific tales of a man who’d go to any length to hold beauty captive. But the more she shares, the more the agents have to wonder what she’s still hiding…","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m0xFUwk-L._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg",5,100

Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. . . . There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavior and his great dignity. I do not understand these things, he thought.
